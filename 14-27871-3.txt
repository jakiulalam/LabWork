3.variable23 is an atom: it starts with a lower case letter.

4.Variable2000 is a variable: it starts with a capital letter.
 
5.big_kahuna_burger is an atom: it starts with a lower case letter.

6.'big kahuna burger' is an atom: it is between two quotes (').

1.loves(Vincent,mia) is a complex term. Functor is loves with arity.

2. 'loves(Vincent,mia)' is an atom: it is enclosed between quotes. 

3.Butch(boxer) is not a term. It starts with a capital letter and can therefore not be an atom or a complex term. It cannot be a variable either because variables are not supposed to contain parentheses.
 
4.boxer(Butch) is a complex term. Functor is boxer with arity 

5. and(big(burger),kahuna(burger)) is a complex term. Functor is and with arity 
 The arguments are again complex terms.

6.and(big(X),kahuna(X)) is a complex term. Functor is and with arity

7. _and(big(X),kahuna(X)) is not a term. It starts with an underscore and can therefore not be an atom or a complex term. It cannot be a variable either because variables are not supposed to contain parentheses or commas. 

8.(Butch kills Vincent) is not a term. It contains parentheses and empty spaces and can therefore neither be an atom nor a variable. It doesn't have the right format for a complex term either; there is no functor.

9.kills(Butch Vincent) is not a term. However, adding a comma between Butch and Vincent would make it into a complex term. 

10.kills(Butch,Vincent is not a term. However, adding a closing parenthesis at the end would make it into a complex term.
